## Project Title
`Efficient High-dimensional Robust  Variable Selection via Rank-based LASSO Methods`[`Report`](https://github.com/ArkaB-DS/rankLASSO/blob/main/Robust_Project_II.pdf)[`Slides`](https://github.com/ArkaB-DS/rankLASSO/blob/main/Robust_Project_II__slides_.pdf)

## Abstract
> Penalized variable selection is a popular approach for describing the relationship between the response, $Y$ and explanatory variables, $X$. LASSO-based methods have received special attention throughout the literature of regression analysis. But stringent conditions are imposed on the $X-y$ relation and on the error distribution. In this report, we present Rank-LASSO as a robust, superior method over the general LASSO, which can be used even when number of predictors is much larger than the sample size. The major properties of the Rank-LASSO has been presented in a non-asymptotic fashion, which makes it useful for the aforementioned case of $p >> n$. The report also shows the superiority of the thresholded modified version of Rank-LASSO in more general scenarios. Apart from theoretical results, we present numerical experiments for demonstrating that performance of the Rank-LASSO is substantially better than regular LAD-LASSO in terms of robust model selection problems. The report is primarily based on [1].
